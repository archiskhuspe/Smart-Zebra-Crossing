ðŸ’« Importance

Usually at a traffic signal, vehicles stop on the zebra crossing line which, according to traffic  rules, is not allowed and our aim is to avoid that using technology. Our plan is to use some sensors which will sense the presence of the vehicles on the zebra crossing line.

ðŸ’« Methodology

The plan is to implement ultra-sonic sensors followed by some buzzers which would beep when  a vehicle crosses the zebra crossing line while the signal is red. If the signal is green, the sensor  wonâ€™t detect the presence of the vehicle.

The sensor detects the ultrasonic sound waves of a vehicle, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. And since, these sensors are connected to a buzzer with help of wires, the buzzers will beep.
